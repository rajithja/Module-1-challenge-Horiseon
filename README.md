## _**Decription of the assignment**_

This project is undertaken as the weekly challenge assignment for the U of T coding bootcamp module-1 which covers the three web development technologies that are fundamental for a web developer: HTML, CSS, and Git.

The assignment for this module requires the developer to take an existing code and refactor it to make the website more accessible. The client, a marketing agency, requires a codebase that follows accessibility standards in-order for the site to be optimized for search engines.
